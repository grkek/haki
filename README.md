### GUI framework with GTK4 component generation using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

- None of the components generated by Layout contain anything remotely related to a Web-Browser.

- Compiled binary reads the custom HTML and builds the GTK components. Since it is already a pre-built release version, it is pretty fast at generating the UI components.

- The compiler supports CSS and JavaScript compilation, which glues the components and makes the UI interactive.

- The JavaScript engine is Duktape, it supports Babel 6.26.0 and CoreJS 2.6.11.

- The CSS is limited to GTK4 specification.

## Installation

Before you clone the shard and build it, install the GTK libraries.

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  haki:
    github: grkek/haki
```

And run this command in your terminal:

```bash
shards install
./bin/gi-crystal
```

# Code example
Add this to your `application.cr`:

```crystal
require "haki"

# Disable GC for now.
GC.disable

html = <<-HTML
  <Application applicationId="com.haki.application">
    <Window title="Untitled Window">
      <Label>Hello, World!</Label>
    </Window>
  </Application>
HTML

builder = Haki::Builder.new
# Make sure you point the path the correct way.
builder.build_from_string(html)
```

Compile the `application.cr` file.

```bash
crystal run application.cr -Dpreview_mt --error-trace
```

And you should have a GUI window with a "Hello, World!" text.
